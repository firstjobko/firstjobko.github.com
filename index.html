		<h1>Fresh Graduates: Would You Like To Send<br>
		Your Resum&#233; Directly to Hiring Managers <br>
		Looking for New Graduates?</h1>

		<p>Landing a job right after graduation is very difficult. You are inexperienced, you have zero connections and you think employers always prefer applicants who have relevant working experience. Still, you keep sending job applications to companies that are not willing to hire inexperienced people. It is very frustrating when they do not reply and ignore your application letter.</p>
